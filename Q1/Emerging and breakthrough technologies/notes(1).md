**Project aspects of the innovation process:**

Typical phases in the process

1. Strategicphase(toinnovateornot)
2. Ideageneration,testingandselection
3. Conceptgeneration,testingandselection
4. Product development,testingandimprovement
5. Productiondevelopment
6. Marketing development
7. Marketintroduction
8. Lifecyclemanagement

(check the lecture 1 slides)

> 1. Innovation processes evolve on multiple levels simultaneously
> 2. Examples of innovation processes on three levels: project, technology and multi-technology level.
> 3. That an innovation is more than a new product alone, each product innovation is part of a larger mix of aspects.
> 4. What possible consequences are of this mix of aspects around an innovation.
> 5. Typical phases of an innovation project and which ones are often forgotten.
> 6. Why phases are scheduled in parallel/sequential and why iterations are required.

"dumb platform" - a platform that is not smart enough to do anything by itself, but it is smart enough to connect to other devices and make them smart.
-> transaction is not internalized

network eddects: two types:

* Indirect network effects: the value of a product or service increases as the number of users increases;
* Direct network effects: the value of a product or service increases as the number of complementary products or services increases.

Pipeline -> Platform:

* Resources: control -> orchestration
* Internal optimization -> external interaction
* Value: customer -> ecosystem

Platform types:
Internal & External

Internal: the platform is used to connect different parts of the company, e.g. the supply chain, the production process, the sales process, etc.
Main Mechanism: Economies of scope
-> the more different products you produce, the lower the average cost per product.
-> Arise when knowledge, production processes, distribution channels, etc. can be shared between different products.

* **Model 1**: Life cycle model explaining what to expect:
  Mainstream model of pattern of devolopment and diffusion: S-curve(almost perfect eg: telephone, television, etc.)
  * if you introduce an innovation it should be first time right.
  * the sucess of your innovtion is reflected in the diffusion rate.
  * ...
  **Conclusion**:
  * Long period after invention


* **Model 2**: Evolutionary model
  
* **Model 3**: Chaotic model

Different theories:
1. Rogers diffusion model(Smooth curve yet deviant innovators)
    Moore(Crossing the Chasm): 
    Markham(Valley of Death):

Factors explaining stabilization phase:

**Theoretical perspectives of disciplines on these factors:**

* Psychologists (individuals)
* Sociologists (groups)
* Economists (financial aspects society
* Engineers (technical system performance))

1. Project
2. Pattern:
  unit = technology
    1. Technology principle
    2. functionality
    3. (sub)systems
(second part of the picture(mkt adaption phase))people don't agree thit the the what it is(different version of products) and move on and change $\rightarrow$ mkt stabilization phase

(st dev): standard deviation: how much the data is spread out from the mean, which means that the smaller the standard deviation, the closer the data points are to the mean.

1. In house-development strategy: the company develops the technology itself.
2. Joint development strategy: the company develops the technology together with a partner.
3. Subsidized development strategy: the company develops the technology with the help of subsidies.
**eg**. Apple use GPS technology from the US government.
4. Pre-funding development strategy: the company develops the technology with the help of pre-funding.
5. Sell idea, concept or design: the company sells the idea, concept or design to a third party.
**eg**. Parmaceutical companies sell the idea of a new drug to a company that develops the drug.
6. Demo experiment strategy: the company develops a demo experiment to show the technology to potential customers.
**eg**. (For) People are happy to be the first to have(test) a new technology. Bell Labs(telegraph)
7. Wait & see strategy: the company waits until the technology is developed by others.
**eg**. General Electric waited until the technology and went into production.


## 8 10.9

Ten niche strategies + application

1. Demo, experiment and develop niche strategy: the company develops a demo experiment to show the technology to potential customers.
2. Top niche strategy: the company develops a technology for the top of the market.
3. Subsidized niche strategy: the company develops the technology with the help of subsidies.
4. Redesign niche strategy: the company redesigns the technology for a new market.
5. Dedicated system or stand-alone niche strategy: the company develops a dedicated system or stand-alone technology.
6. Hybridization or adaptor niche strategy: the company develops a technology that combines two existing technologies.
7. Educate niche strategy:  involve identifying a specific market segment, providing educational content to build credibility and trust within that segment, and ultimately marketing a product or service that addresses the specific needs of that niche.
8. Geographic niche strategy: the company develops a technology for a specific geographic market.
9. Lead user niche strategy: the company develops a technology for lead users.
10. Explore multiple markets niche strategy: the company develops a technology for multiple markets.

Hightech products, production system,...
Why the assumptions for the diffusion model and necessary conditions the same?


lubrication: 润滑
skimming penetration differention niche:
(like skimming the milk off the top of the milk bottle)

Basic mechanism:

1. Evolution: One tech evolves natually from other
Defination of a tech: tech principle + functionality + main subsystems
2. Discipline: group of techs that are related to each other
3. Competition: 
4. Complement: software+hardware
5. Supply:

For music industry, we can adapt the following strategies based different assumptions that may be our barriers:

* In this dacade, the music industry is dominated by the top artists, and the top artists are the most popular ones. So we can focus on the top artists and their music. (Top niche strategy)(eg. use VIP)
* Recently, there are some brand new types of music concerts, such as the online concerts(metaverse concerts). We can develop a technology for these new types of music concerts. (Top niche strategy + Hybridization or adaptor niche strategy + (Demo, experiment and develop niche strategy(perhaps?)))
* Blockchain technology is a new technology that can be used in the music industry. We can develop a technology that combines blockchain technology and music industry. Due to the maturity of traditional music industry,the ways and methods they use are not suitable for the new technology. So we can develop a technology that combines blockchain technology and music industry. (Hybridization or adaptor niche strategy) 
* Considering too much competition in the music industry, the cost of complex new technology or the new form may be not that easy to be accepted by the market. So like Telegraphy was demonstrated in multiple cities before it was put into use,this kind of technology can be demonstrated in our company tickets selling. (Demo, experiment and develop niche strategy)
* Redesign niche strategy can be used in this company to simplify the process of buying tickets. For example, we can redesign the process of buying tickets to make it more convenient for customers to buy tickets. (Redesign niche strategy)
