### 1.1 企业的四类组织形式

#### **Q1. What is a limited liability company (LLC)? How does it differ from a limited partnership?**

**Limited Liability Company (LLC):**

1. **Limited Liability:** One of the primary advantages of an LLC is that it provides limited liability protection to its owners, known as members. This means that members are typically not personally responsible for the company's debts and liabilities. Their liability is limited to their investment in the LLC.
2. **Management:** LLCs offer flexibility in management. They can be member-managed, where all members have a say in the day-to-day operations, or manager-managed, where members appoint a manager (who may or may not be a member) to handle the business operations.
3. **Taxation:** By default, an LLC is a pass-through entity for tax purposes, meaning that the business itself does not pay federal income taxes. Instead, profits and losses "pass through" to the individual members, who report them on their personal tax returns. However, LLCs have the option to elect corporate taxation if they choose.
4. **Ownership:** LLCs can have an unlimited number of members, and members can be individuals, other businesses, or even foreign entities.

**Limited Partnership (LP):**

1. **Limited Liability:** In an LP, there are two types of partners: general partners and limited partners. General partners have unlimited personal liability for the partnership's debts and actions, while limited partners have limited liability and are typically only liable up to the amount they've invested in the partnership.
2. **Management:** LPs must have at least one general partner who manages the day-to-day operations and has unlimited liability. Limited partners, on the other hand, are passive investors and cannot participate in management without risking their limited liability status.
3. **Taxation:** Similar to LLCs, LPs are often treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes. Profits and losses pass through to the partners' personal tax returns. However, some LPs may elect to be taxed as a corporation.
4. **Ownership:** LPs typically have at least one general partner and one or more limited partners. The general partner(s) have more control and responsibility for the business, while limited partners are primarily investors.

> In summary, the key differences between an LLC and an LP are the level of liability protection, management structure, and the roles of the partners. LLCs provide limited liability to all members and offer flexibility in management, while LPs have a mix of general and limited partners with differing levels of liability and specific roles. Both structures offer tax flexibility, with pass-through taxation being the default for most situations. The choice between an LLC and an LP depends on the specific needs and preferences of the business owners. It's important to consult with legal and financial professionals when making this decision to ensure it aligns with your goals and circumstances.

#### Q2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of organizing a business as a corporation?

- **Advantages of a corporation**:

1. **Limited liability**. The shareholders of a corporation are only liable up tothe amount of their investments. They are not personally responsible for the debts or lawsuits of the business. This can protect their personal assets from creditors or legal claims.
2. **Source of capital**. A corporation can raise funds by selling shares or issuing bonds to investors. This can provide more financial resources for the business to grow and expand. A publicly-held corporation, which trades its shares on a stock exchange, can have easier access to capital than a privately-held corporation.
3. **Ownership transfers**. It is relatively easy for a shareholder to sell or transfer their shares in a corporation, especially if it is publicly-held. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for the owners.
4. **Perpetual life**. A corporation can exist indefinitely, regardless of the death or departure of its shareholders or managers. It can continue to operate as long as it complies with the state laws and regulations.
5. **Pass through**. If the corporation is structured as an S corporation, it can avoid double taxation by passing its profits and losses directly to its shareholders, who report them on their personal income tax returns. This can reduce the tax burden on the business and its owners.

- **Disadvantages of a corporation**:

1. **Double taxation**. If the corporation is structured as a C corporation, it pays taxes on its income at the corporate level, and then its shareholders pay taxes on their dividends at the individual level. This can result in higher taxes for the business and its owners than other types of entities.
2. **Excessive tax filings**. A corporation may have to file various types of taxes at the federal, state, and local levels, depending on its income, expenses, assets, and activities. This can require a lot of paperwork and compliance costs for the business.
3. **Independent management**. A corporation may have a separation between its owners and its managers, who may have different goals and interests. The shareholders may have little control or influence over the decisions and actions of the managers, who may not act in their best interests.
4. **Rigid formalities and protocols**. A corporation must follow strict rules and procedures to maintain its legal status and protect its limited liability. These may include holding regular meetings, keeping minutes and records, filing annual reports, and paying fees to the state.

| Why is EBITDA used to assess a firm's<br />ability to meet its interest obligations?<br />(EBITDA = EBIT +Depreciation and <br />Amortization ) | EBIT(息税前利润)<br />a measure of the cash a firm generates from its operations and has<br />available to make interest payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| What is the difference between a firm's<br /> book debt-equity ratio and its market <br />debt-equity ratio?                                   | In summary, the key difference between the two ratios lies in the<br />source of values used for debt and equity. The book debt-equity <br />ratio relies on accounting values from the company's financial <br />statements, while the market debt-equity ratio is based on market <br />values derived from the stock and bond markets. As a result, these <br />ratios may provide different perspectives on a firm's financial <br />leverage and risk, as market values can be influenced by investor <br />sentiment and market conditions, whereas book values are <br />historical and may not reflect current market perceptions. |

## 9.12

* If the NPV is the same, just compare the IRR.

$$
EAR = (1+\frac{APR}{k})^k = (if k ~\rightarrow \infty) e^{APR}

$$

financial instrument: 金融工具

* eg. stock, bond, option, future, swap


Different instruments serve different purposes and satisfy different investor
preferences, such as:

* Claims on future cash flow;(equity holders)
* Right to participate in company decisions;()
* Privileged, but limited right to cash flow;()
* Claims on company assets in liquidation.()

* For shareholders, the expected rate of return on a stock is the sum of the expected dividend yield and the expected capital gains yield.(**stock**)
* For a company, the expected rate of return on a stock is the **cost of equity capital**.

g的推导：
$$
g = \frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{New investment  \times Return rate on NI}{E}
  = Rentention rate \times Return rate on NI
$$
