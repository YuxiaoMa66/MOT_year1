## Airline Passenger Satisfaction {.tabset}

### 1. Introduction

```{r intro image, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%",fig.align='center',fig.cap = "https://www.pexels.com/photo/group-of-tourists-in-queue-before-boarding-4606684/"}

```

The airline industry faces a persistent challenge in customer satisfaction, a matter that affect company´s reputation and loyalty. When considering the fierce competition in the industry, customer satisfaction makes plays a major role in a business trade-off that may lead either to substantial economic profits or losses depending on the management adopted. Airlines must diligently assess their service chains to pinpoint areas that impact customer journey experience. Before, in-flight, or customer service play a pivotal role, as they directly influence passenger perceptions. \#### 1.1 Business Problem Identification Thus, the central business problem lies in pinpointing the specific elements of flight services that become most influential on passenger satisfaction. This knowledge paves the way for airlines to develop targeted strategies to mitigate customer dissatisfaction and improve their service offerings during potential disruptive events. \#### 1.2 Translation to Machine Learning Task Currently, research on customer satisfaction often lacks an individualized perspective, generally focusing on airport or airline-level assessments. We can therefore translate this business problem into a prediction task by analyzing data on passenger experience that train machine learning models to predict levels of passenger satisfaction. Ultimately, the insights of this analysis serves to make business decisions on whether improve services, reputation management, and a broader understanding of the customer side.

### 2. Data Preparation

```{=html}
<!-- -  PCA only for categorical variables because of information loss. We found that accuracy in Model 1 is lower for a PCA in all variables.  
-   Elaborate on not losing critical information.-->
```
#### 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset, called "airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv" [@kaggle]

```{r dataset features, echo = FALSE}
dta_features <- data.frame(
  Field.Name = character(length(dta_csv)),  # Character vector for field names
  Field.Info = character(length(dta_csv)),  # Character vector for field descriptions
  Variable.Type = character(length(dta_csv))  # Character vector for variable types
)
#temporal vector with dictionary raw information

dta_features$Field.Name <- tmp[seq(1, length(tmp), 3)]
dta_features$Field.Info <- tmp[seq(2, length(tmp), 3)]
dta_features$Variable.Type <- tmp[seq(3, length(tmp), 3)]
```

```{r show dataframe, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(dta_features, caption = "TABLE: Dataset features")
```

In the table here above all the variables are displayed and their key characteristics. Most of the variables (19) are Numeric, 5 of them are non-numeric. The non-numeric varibles have to be converted to numeric variables in a later stage in order to use them for further analysis. The numeric variable **ID** will be deleted since it doesn't add any information. It is just an increasing number for every individual data point in the dataset.

#### 2.2 Data pre-processing

In this chapter, we will start with data pre-processing. This involves four steps: 1. data exploration; 2. data cleaning; 3. creating dummy variables where required; 4. normalization of variables where required.

##### 2.2.1 Data exploration

In this section, we will explore our data. This step involves getting familiar with our data. What type of variables are we dealing with (numeric / categorical)? How does the data look like? Are we dealing with missing information or outliers? This information is essiantial in order to process our data in later steps. We start off by making a distinction between non-numeric (hence: categorical) and numeric variables, followed by exploring each individual variable within these categories.

###### 2.2.1.1 Non-numeric variables

We start our analysis with the non-numeric variables according to the table in section 2.1. For quick info on these variables, we use the following code chunk:

```{r}
# see quick info of category values (not including the numeric ones)
sapply(dta[,sapply(dta, is.character)], table)
```

To gain more insights in these variables, each of these are plotted in a barplot:

```{r create barplots for the non-numeric variables in our data frame}
# Determine which columns are non-numeric
non_numerical_columns <- sapply(dta, function(x) !is.numeric(x))

#Display non-numeric variable names
for(column in names(dta)[non_numerical_columns]) {
  print(column) #satisfaction is the predictive variable, hence we don't want this in our dataframe
}

non_numeric_variables <- dta[, non_numerical_columns] #creates a data frame containing the information of the non numeric variables

# barplot for the non-numerical variable 'Gender'
bp_Gender <- barplot(table(non_numeric_variables$Gender), names.arg = names(non_numeric_variables$Gender), main="Gender")
text(x=bp_Gender, y=table(non_numeric_variables$Gender),labels=table(non_numeric_variables$Gender), pos=3, offset=0.5, xpd=TRUE)

# barplot for the non-numerical variable 'Customer Type'
bp_CustomerType <- barplot(table(non_numeric_variables$Customer.Type), names.arg = names(non_numeric_variables$Customer.Type), main="Customer Type")
text(x=bp_CustomerType, y=table(non_numeric_variables$Customer.Type),labels=table(non_numeric_variables$Customer.Type), pos=3, offset=0.5, xpd=TRUE)

# barplot for the non-numerical variable 'Type of Travel'
bp_TypeOfTravel <- barplot(table(non_numeric_variables$Type.of.Travel), names.arg = names(non_numeric_variables$Type.of.Travel), main="Type of Travel")
text(x=bp_TypeOfTravel, y=table(non_numeric_variables$Type.of.Travel),labels=table(non_numeric_variables$Type.of.Travel), pos=3, offset=0.5, xpd=TRUE)

# barplot for the non-numeric variable 'Class' 
bp_Class <- barplot(table(non_numeric_variables$Class), names.arg = names(non_numeric_variables$Class), main="Class")
text(x=bp_Class, y=table(non_numeric_variables$Class),labels=table(non_numeric_variables$Class), pos=3, offset=0.5, xpd=TRUE)

# barplot for the non-numeric variable 'Satisfaction'
bp_Satisfaction <- barplot(table(non_numeric_variables$Satisfaction), names.arg = names(non_numeric_variables$Satisfaction), main="Satisfaction")
text(x=bp_Satisfaction, y=table(non_numeric_variables$Satisfaction),labels=table(non_numeric_variables$Satisfaction), pos=3, offset=0.5, xpd=TRUE)

remove(bp_Class, bp_CustomerType, bp_Gender, bp_Satisfaction, bp_TypeOfTravel)
```

The barplots above show each categorical variable including the frequencies of it's content. It gives us valuable insights in the data of these variables, ie the variable "Class" has only 7.25% travelers that travel with 'Economy Plus' (9411 out of 129880 travelers). The rest of the travelers are traveling with either Economy or Business Class. Another example is the variable "Customer Type", which shows that only 18.31% of the travelers are traveling for the first time (23780 out of 129880 travelers), the rest is a returning traveler.

If we look closely to the output of the above code chunk, we notice that the variable "Satisfaction" is the variable we want to predict. Hence, this is our Predictive Variable (PV). Therefore, we will leave out this variable for now and carry on with the data frame *non_numeric_df* without this variable. To clean up the data environment, the data frame non_numeric_variables is deleted.

```{r remove predictive variable (PV)}
remove(non_numeric_variables)

non_numeric_dta <- dta[, non_numerical_columns] #creates a data frame that contains only non-numeric variables
non_numeric_dta <- non_numeric_dta[ ,c(1:4)] # leave out 'satisfaction' as this is the predictive variable
```

###### 2.2.1.2 Numeric variables

We continue our analysis with the numeric variables according to the table in section 2.1. To gain insights in this data, we first make R distinguish the numeric variables from the categorical variables (recall from section 2.1 that the variable "ID" will not be taken into account, this is done in the last line of the code chunk):

```{r numeric columns}
numeric_columns <- sapply(dta, function(x) is.numeric(x))

#Display non-numeric variable names
for(column in names(dta)[numeric_columns]) {
  print(column) #satisfaction is the predictive variable, hence we don't want this in our dataframe
}

numeric_variables <- dta[,numeric_columns] #creates a data frame containing the information of the non numeric variables
numeric_variables <- numeric_variables[2:19] #remove the variable "ID" from the data frame
```

Hence, from the above we can deduct there are indeed 18 (19 minus the variable "ID") variables. To have a first general idea about these variables (without "ID"), we look at the summary of this data:

```{r first impression of the numerical data}
summary(numeric_variables)
```

We find from this observation that the variable "Arrival.Delay" contains 393 missing values (NA's). We will deal with this in section 2.2.2.

To explore these variables further, we want to see the distribution of each individual variable. For numerical variables, this distribution can be deducted from a histogram and boxplot. This is done for each numerical variable (besides "ID") in the chunk below:

```{r make plots for all numeric variables}
#Names of the numerical columns
numeric_vars <- names(dta)[sapply(dta, is.numeric)]  #create a vector of numerical variables
numeric_vars <- numeric_vars[2:19] #recreate the same vector leaving out the "ID" variable

# Loop through variables and make boxplots
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

for(i in numeric_vars) {
  boxplot(dta[[i]])
  hist(dta[[i]], xlab = "score", main = i)
}
```

The "plotting-pairs" (boxplot and histogram) provide us with valuable information concerning the data stored in each variable. This information is key to determine conclusions regarding outliers or skewed data, which must be dealt with. This is done in the next sections.

```{r distribution visulization function}
library(ggplot2)
# using ggplot to visualize the distribution of the non-numeric variables as barplot
pplotbar <- function(df, col) {
  ggplot(df, aes_string(col)) +
    geom_bar(stat="count") +
    geom_text(stat="count", aes(label=after_stat(count)), vjust=1.6, color="white") +

                            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),

}
```

##### 2.2.2 Data cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of identifying erroneous, incomplete or irrelevant portions of data. Then, this data must be either modified, replaced or deleted in order to improve its quality and make it more suitable for drawing conclusions or to use it in the modeling phase. This section proceeds in the data exploration phase by identifying outliers, skewed data, and dealing with the NA's in the variable Arrival.Delay.

###### 2.2.2.1 Missing Values

We first focus on the missing values in Arrival.Delay. In the 'quick and dirty' method in section 2.2.1 we saw (by the simple function summary) that this variable had 393 NA's. Let's dive deeper into this issue:

```{r finding NAs}
missing_values <- dta[which(dta$Arrival.Delay %in% NA), ]  
print(missing_values)
```

The code chunk above shows all the 393 rows that have the missing value (NA) in the variable Arrival.Delay. To deal with these missing values, there are multiple options: 1. omit them completely; 2. mean imputation, which implies replacing 'NA' values with "best estimates" such as the mean value. 3. imputation using regression.

Although the number of missing values is very small compared to the total number of observations, we think that the purest option is to impute the missing values by using regression. To to this, we first require a regression model to predict the Arrival.Delay variable. Then, this model can be used to fill the missing values in that same variable. This is done in the folling code chunk:

```{r using regression to impute data in the missing values in the Arrival.Delay variable}
lmAD <- lm(Arrival.Delay ~ Departure.Delay, data = dta) #create a Linear Model of the Arrival Delay variable 
summary(lmAD)

#fill missing values in the Arrival Delay variable using the regression model
dta$Arrival.Delay[is.na(dta$Arrival.Delay)] <- predict(lmAD, newdata = dta[is.na(dta$Arrival.Delay),])
```

We can now continue with the data frame 'dta' that does not contain any NA values any more:

```{r prove there are no missing values (NA) any more within the dta data frame}
table(is.na(dta))
```

The final action we have in this section is to convert data frames containing 1. categorical variables and 2. numerical variables into 'new' data frames derived from the adjusted dta data frame:

```{r update the categorical and numerical data frames with the imputed data from the regression model}
#update the non-numeric (categorical) data frame so it has no NA values any more
non_numeric_dta <- dta[, non_numerical_columns]
non_numeric_dta <- non_numeric_dta[ ,c(1:4)]

#update the numeric data frame so it has no NA values any more
numeric_columns <- sapply(dta, function(x) is.numeric(x))
numeric_variables <- dta[,numeric_columns] 
numeric_variables <- numeric_variables[2:19]
```

###### 2.2.2.2 Outliers and skewed data

Secondly, we will look for data that needs to be cleaned. A possible cause is the presence of outliers in the variable. The presence of outliers in a variable can be determined with a variation of tools: 1. By examination of the univariate plots (see section 2.2.1); 2. Via several statistical means. One or more outliers are very likely to exist if: - There is a big difference between the median and mean; - The standard deviation \> mean; - The maximum observations stand out compared to the scale of other indicators.

Skewed data is recognizable by evaluating the graphical distribution, ie the histograms from section 2.1.1. In these plots, the data points are not symmetrical or evenly distributed around the mean (might be a result of the presence of outliers, but not necessarily).

The following code chunk will calculate the most important statistical aspects: standard deviation, mean, median, min-range, and max-range:

```{r calculate the standard deviation, mean, median, and min-max range for each variable (column)}
numerical_stats <- data.frame(apply(numeric_variables, 2, sd),
                              apply(numeric_variables, 2, mean),
                              apply(numeric_variables, 2, median),
                              apply(numeric_variables, 2, min),
                              apply(numeric_variables, 2, max))
colnames(numerical_stats) <- c("Standard Deviation", "mean", "median", "min", "max")
print(numerical_stats)
```

It's important to deal with outliers and skewed data because many models are sensitive to them. By conducting the criteria for finding outliers as stated at the beginning of this section, we can conclude from the univariate graphs in section 2.2 and the table above that the following numeric variables contain outliers: - Flight Distance - Departure Delay - Arrival Delay.

From the boxplots and histograms in section 2.2, we can already see that these variables have outliers. For example, the boxplot of the variable Departure.Delay shows many points outside of the upper whisker (which has a max length of 1.5 times the interquartile range). This typically indicates outliers. This view is supported by its histogram, since the majority of observations are captured on the left side of the graph (skewed data). The same is true for Arrival.Delay and Flight.Distance.

The following code chunk shows the boxplots and histograms (including the mean and median value) for these variables. This makes it more clear that we are dealing with outliers in these variables.

```{r,include=TRUE, error= TRUE}
names_num <- c('Flight.Distance', 'Departure.Delay', 'Arrival.Delay')

for (i in names_num) {
  plot(plothist(dta, i))
  pbox(dta, i)
}
```

We cannot directly use the data from the variables containing outliers. Therefore, this data must be normalized This is done in section 2.2.4.

##### 2.2.3 Dummy variables

Having non-numeric variables can call for data manipulation such as creating "dummy" variables.\
We have identified that there are 5 non-numeric variables in the dataset.

```{r Make the difference between numerical and non-numerical variables}
#Determine the number of numerical and non-numerical names
numerical_columns <- table(sapply(dta,is.numeric))
rownames(numerical_columns) <- c("Non-Numerical","Numerical")
print(numerical_columns)
```

The 5 non-numerical variables are as follows:

**1.** *Gender*

**2.** *Customer.Type*

**3.** *Type.of.Travel*

**4.** *Class*

**5.** *Satisfaction*

The next step is to split the non-numeric variables into different groups of dummy variables

```{r splitting variables to groups}
type_gender <- unique(dta$Gender)
type_gender
type_cust <- unique(dta$Customer.Type)
type_cust
type_travel <- unique(dta$Type.of.Travel)
type_travel
type_class <- unique(dta$Class)
type_class
type_satis <- unique(dta$Satisfaction)
type_satis
```

```{r}
# Gender, according to the unique values
dta$Gender_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Gender %in% type_gender[1], 1, 0) #gender: 1 for Male, 0 for Female

# Customer.Type, according to the unique values
dta$Customer_type_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Customer.Type %in% type_cust[1], 1, 0)# Customer_type: 1 for first time; 2 for returning

# Type.of.Travel, according to the unique values
dta$Type_of_travel_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Type.of.Travel %in% type_travel[1], 1, 0)# Type_of_travel: 1 for buis; 0 for personal

# Satisfaction, according to the unique values
dta$Satisfaction_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Satisfaction %in% type_satis[2], 1, 0)#Satisfaction_satis: 1 for satisfied,; 0 for Neutral or Dissatisfied

# Class, according to the unique values (3 classes so 2 dummy variables)
dta$Class_business_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Class %in% type_class[1], 1, 0) #Class_business: 1 for business, 0 for not Business

dta$Class_economy_dummy <- ifelse(dta$Class %in% type_class[2], 1, 0)
#Class_economy_isEconomy: 1 for Economy; 0 for not Economy

```

In the code chunk above the non-numeric variables are transformed in to dummy variables the structure of them is as follows:

Gender: 1 for Male, 0 for Female

Customer_type: 1 for First-Time, 0 for Returning

Type_of_travel: 1 for Business, 0 for Personal

Satisfaction: 1 for satisfied, 0 for Neutral or Dissatisfied

Class is the the only transformed variable that has 3 classes, the number of dummy variables is FORMULA, ergo 2 dummy variables for the variable class

Class_business: 1 for business, 0 for not Business

Class_economy: 1 for Economy; 0 for not Economy

```{r}
dta <- dta[, !names(dta) %in% c("Gender", "Customer.Type", "Type.of.Travel", "Class", "Satisfaction")]
#Removing non-numerical collums
#dta <- dta[ ,-which(colnames(dta) == c("Gender", "Customer.Type", "Type.of.Travel", "Class", "Satisfaction"))]

```

Lastly the original variables that have now been transformed to dummy variables are removed from the dataset.

##### 2.2.4 Normalization

In the previous section, we have seen that the distribution of Flight.Distance, Departure.Delay, and Arrival.Delay are not normal and have many outliers. This section will deal with that issue by using two normalization approaches: Box-Cox transformation and arctan transformation. After the transformations, the newly created variables will be scaled to a set interval. The aim of rescaling is to get to a variable distribution that matches the data assumption of an analytic technique. We will use Box-Cox transformation to normalize Flight.Distance and arctan transformation to normalize Departure.Delay and Arrival.Delay.

This section will cover rescaling the variables Departure.Delay, Arrival.Delay, and Flight.Distance from the data cleaning section (2.2.2) as they are required to be scaled for further analysis. Section 2.3 covers Principle Component Analysis (PCA) where scaling of the other required variables will be conducted.

We will start off with the transformation of the variable Flight.Distance. This is done by the following code chunk:

```{r}
# boxcox transformation
library(MASS)
boxcox(dta$Flight.Distance ~ 1)
# choose lambda as the one that maximizes the log-likelihood
bcFD <- boxcox(dta$Flight.Distance ~ 1, plotit = FALSE)
lambda <- bcFD$x[which.max(bcFD$y)]
print(lambda)
```

The value of lambda is 0.1, which represents the maximum value for the log-likelyhood as shown in the upper graph. Now, we can use this value to normalize the variable Flight.Distance:

```{r}
# transform Flight.Distance using the lambda
dta$bcFD <- (dta$Flight.Distance^lambda - 1) / lambda
summary(dta$bcFD)
```

By executing the code chunk above, we created an extra variable "bcFD" (which stands for Box-Cox Flight Distance). By applying this transformation, we can see that the data distribution has been normalized and there are no outliers any more. For comparison, the following chunk shows a 2x2 grid of graphs: one "pair" (histogram & boxplot) of the unscaled (non-normalized) variable (Flight.Distance) and one "pair" of the scaled variable (bcFD).

```{r comparison of the initial and scaled variable Flight Distance}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the initial variable Flight Distance
hist(dta$Flight.Distance)
pbox(dta, "Flight.Distance")

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the scaled variable Departure Delay
hist(dta$bcFD)
pbox(dta, "bcFD")
```

Now we have dealt with the outliers, we must scale this variable in order to create a suitable interval without losing information (ie the distibutions must be preserved). The following code chunk will scale the newly created variable bcFD to the interval [0,1] by using the min-max scaling. For comparison, the summary function will be executed on both the initial and scaled variable. This chunk will also plot (boxplot and histogram) the scaled variable.

```{r}
dta$bcFD <- (dta$bcFD - min(dta$bcFD)) / (max(dta$bcFD) - min(dta$bcFD)) #scale bcFD
summary(dta$Flight.Distance) # statistics of the initial variable Flight.Distance
summary(dta$bcFD) # statistics of the scaled variable bcFD

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
pbox(dta, "bcFD")
hist(dta$bcFD)
```

It can be seen that the initial variable has values within the range [31,4983] while it's scaled variant bcFD has values within the range [0,1]. Moreover, the data distribution of the scaled variable didn't change compared to the plots after the transformation (before scaling). This is an important property of scaling. In the next sections, the variable *bcFD* within the dta dataframe will be used for further analysis instead of Flight.Distance.

Now we will continue with a similar approach for Departure.Delay. This time, the arctan standardization approach will be utilized. The arctan transformation is helpful to normalize the data and reduce the impact of outliers as it compresses the range of the data (especially when the data is skewed, which is the case). The following code chunk will execute the arctan transformation and the resulting (scaled) interval is observed by executing the summary command. For comparison, the statistical measures of the initial variable Departure.Delay are shown as well.

```{r}
# arctan transformation adjusted
adjarctan <- function(x) {
  (2/pi) * atan(x)
}

# create a new variable "adjDD" in the dta data frame and show it's summary
dta$adjDD <- adjarctan(dta$Departure.Delay)
summary(dta$Departure.Delay)
summary(dta$adjDD)
```

Another new variabe is added to the dta dataframe, namely adjDD (which stands for adjusted Departure.Delay). As can be seen, the interval of the initial variable is [0,1592] with a mean value of 14.72 (hence: outliers!). Within this transformation, the original Departure.Delay variable has scaled the data to the interval [0,1]. This data is then stored to the adjDD variable. For comparison, the following code chunk shows the plots for the initial variable (Departure.Delay) and it's normalized variant (adjDD).

```{r comparison of the initial and scaled variable Departure Delay}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the initial variable Departure Delay
hist(dta$Departure.Delay) 
pbox(dta, "Departure.Delay")

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the scaled variable Departure Delay
hist(dta$adjDD)
pbox(dta, "adjDD")
```

As can be seen in the above plots, the variable adjDD has no outliers any more. This makes it usable for further analysis. Therefore, the newly created *adjDD* within the dta dataframe will be used in the next sections instead of the initial Departure.Delay.

Finally, the same analysis for adjDD will be applied to the variable Arrival.Delay in order to obtain clean data for futher modeling. First, the arctan normalization approach is applied to the variable Arrival.Delay to rescale the range to a scale of [0,1].

```{r apply the arctan normalization approach to Arrival.Delay to create adjAD}
# create a new variable "adjAD" in the dta data frame and show it's summary
dta$adjAD <- adjarctan(dta$Arrival.Delay) #apply the arctan function to create a new variable
summary(dta$Arrival.Delay) #show the statistics of the initial variable
summary(dta$adjAD) #show the statistics of the rescaled variable
```

Similar to the approach in the Departure.Delay variable, the difference between the initial and scaled variable is shown in the plots in the following code chunk:

```{r comparison of the initial and scaled variable Arrival Delay}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the initial variable Departure Delay
hist(dta$Arrival.Delay) 
pbox(dta, "Arrival.Delay")

# plot the histogram and boxplot of the scaled variable Departure Delay
hist(dta$adjAD)
pbox(dta, "adjAD")
```

Similar to the approach for adjDD, the variable adjAD has no outliers any more and it's scaled data is usable for further analysis. Therefore, the newly created *adjAD* within the dta dataframe will be used in the next sections instead of the initial Arrival.Delay.



#### 2.3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Likely has to be only 2.3)

As shown in chapter 2.2, the variables Departure.Delay and Arrival.Delay are highly correlated. After the transformation to adjDD and adjAD, it has to be made sure that the correlation still exists before conduction PCA analysis on them to reduce their dimentionality.


```{r}
# draw scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(dta, aes(x = adjDD, y = adjAD)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "Scatter Plot of adjDD and adjAD", x = "adjDD", y = "adjAD") +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
cor(dta$adjAD, dta$adjDD)

```
From the results of the scatterplot and the correlation calculation, it is clear that they are still multicollinearity and PCA analysis is in order to reduce the dimensionality.

```{r PCA analysis}
# PCA
pca <- prcomp(dta[,c("adjDD", "adjAD")], scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

From the PCA results one can see that the first principal component contains 82.18% of the variance. Therefore it will be used to reprisent both of them from here on out.

```{r}
# choose the first principal component
dta$PCDelay <- pca$x[,1]
summary(dta$PCDelay)
```
As the new variable PCADelay has a greater range than the standard 0-1 in the dataset. It has to be scaled to that range before further data analysis can be conducted.
```{r}
# scaling PCDelay to 0-1
dta$PCDelay <- (dta$PCDelay - min(dta$PCDelay)) / (max(dta$PCDelay) - min(dta$PCDelay))
summary(dta$PCDelay)
```

```{r remove delay variables form the dataset, include=FALSE}
#Remove the old variables for delay and ID
dta <- dta[, !names(dta) %in% c("Departure.Delay", "Arrival.Delay", "adjDD", "adjAD", "ID","Flight.Distance")]

```

```{r heatmap, include=TRUE, error= TRUE, echo=FALSE}

correlation_matrix <- cor(dta) #Create correlation matrix

melted_correlation_matrix <- melt(correlation_matrix) #Melt the correlation matrix

#Can I remove adjDD, adjAD, and bcFD?

ggplot(data = melted_correlation_matrix, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white",
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab",
                       name="Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 40),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "lightcoral", angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 40), # Increase size for Y axis labels as well
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f", value)), size = 3, vjust = 1.5) +
  geom_tile(data = subset(melted_correlation_matrix, abs(value) > 0.7),
            color = "gold", size = 2, fill = NA)# Change before final, is ugly af with the green banner, only for easy visalisaton

# Use ggsave to save the plot to a file, specifying the dimensions
ggsave("heatmapfinal.png", width = 40, height = 30, dpi = 600)

```
Before the modeling stage starts lets look at the correlations of the whole dataset in the form of a heatmap.

```{r heatmap image, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%",fig.align='center',fig.cap = "Heatmap"}

knitr::include_graphics("heatmapfinal.png")
```


One can read from the map that the only strong correlation between 2 variables is a correlation of **0.71** between Ease.of.Online.Booking and In.flight.Wifi.Service.

Considering the lack of strong correlations and that the models used to predict with later in the report take into account dimensions. A decision was made that the cost of information loss due to PCA would outweigh the benefits of dimensionality reduction, so no further PCA analysis will be executed on the dataset.

### 3. Model 1, Tree-based

Based on our processing and analysis of the data in the previous section, the final predictor variable is considered to be a 0-1 binary label, which can be associated with the decision tree content of the course for machine learning. But at the same time, considering the number of independent variables we have, directly using decision trees will cause overfitting due to the "curse of dimensionality".

As a result, instead of using the decision tree model directly in the first stage of this model, we borrow the idea of its algorithm to select features and split the data considering the size of the dimension.

```{r}
# All variables
allnames <- colnames(dta)
print(allnames)
```

We keep variables below as the analysis variables

```{r}
# Independent variables that are already cleaned
# Numerical variables
IV1 <- c("Age","bcFD","PCDelay")
# Dummy
IV2 <- c("Gender_dummy","Customer_type_dummy","Type_of_travel_dummy","Class_business_dummy","Class_economy_dummy")
# Categorical variables
IV3 <- c("Departure.and.Arrival.Time.Convenience", 
              "Ease.of.Online.Booking", 
              "Check.in.Service", 
              "Online.Boarding", 
              "Gate.Location", 
              "On.board.Service", 
              "Seat.Comfort", 
              "Leg.Room.Service", 
              "Cleanliness", 
              "Food.and.Drink", 
              "In.flight.Service", 
              "In.flight.Wifi.Service", 
              "In.flight.Entertainment", 
              "Baggage.Handling")

IV <- c(IV1, IV2, IV3)
# Dependent variable
DV <- "Satisfaction_dummy"
```

```{r}
dta$Age <- (dta$Age - min(dta$Age)) / (max(dta$Age) - min(dta$Age)) #Scaling Age
dta[,IV3] <- dta[,IV3] / 5
```


#### 3.1 Advanced decision-tree-logistic fusion model

Consider implementing the algorithm of the decision tree, we can use the 3 different algorithms to compute the importance of the variables.

1.  Information Gain: $$ \operatorname{Gain}(D, a)=\operatorname{Entropy}(D)-\sum_{k=1}^{V} \frac{\left|D^{v}\right|}{|D|} \operatorname{Entropy}\left(D^{v}\right) $$ where $$ \operatorname{Entropy}(D)=-\sum_{k=1}^{|y|} p_{k} \log _{2} p_{k} $$ and $$ \operatorname{Entropy}\left(D^{v}\right)=-\sum_{k=1}^{|y|} p_{k} \log _{2} p_{k} $$

2.  gain ratio: $$\operatorname{Gain\_ ratio}(D, a)=\frac{\operatorname{Gain}(D, a)}{I V(a)}$$ where $$ IV(a)=-\sum_{v=1}^{V} \frac{\left|D^{v}\right|}{|D|} \log _{2} \frac{\left|D^{v}\right|}{|D|} $$

3.  Gini index: For the dataset D, the Gini index is defined as: $$ \operatorname{Gini}(D)=\sum_{k=1}^{|y|} \sum_{k^{\prime} \neq k} p_{k} p_{k^{\prime}}=1-\sum_{k=1}^{|y|} p_{k}{ }^{2} $$ and the Gini index of attribute a is defined as: $$ \operatorname{Gini\_index} (D, a)=\sum_{v=1}^{V} \frac{\left|D^{v}\right|}{|D|} \operatorname{Gini}\left(D^{v}\right) $$ where $D^{v}$ is the subset of D for which attribute a has the vth value.

```{r}
# function to compute the importance of the variables
compute_importance <- function(data, attribute, target) {

  entropy <- function(p) {
    if (all(p == 0)) return(0) 
    -sum(p * log2(p))
  }
  

  gini <- function(p) {
    1 - sum(p^2)
  }
  

  total_entropy <- entropy(table(data[[target]]) / nrow(data))

  total_gini <- gini(table(data[[target]]) / nrow(data))
  

  weighted_entropy <- 0
  weighted_gini <- 0
  split_info <- 0
  
  attribute_levels <- unique(data[[attribute]])
  for (level in attribute_levels) {
    subset <- data[data[[attribute]] == level,]
    level_prob <- nrow(subset) / nrow(data)
    
    subset_entropy <- entropy(table(subset[[target]]) / nrow(subset))
    subset_gini <- gini(table(subset[[target]]) / nrow(subset))
    
    weighted_entropy <- weighted_entropy + level_prob * subset_entropy
    weighted_gini <- weighted_gini + level_prob * subset_gini
    split_info <- split_info + (-level_prob * log2(level_prob))
  }
  
  info_gain <- total_entropy - weighted_entropy
  gain_ratio <- ifelse(split_info == 0, 0, info_gain / split_info) 
  imp_gini_index <- total_gini - weighted_gini
  
  return(list(info_gain = info_gain, gain_ratio = gain_ratio, gini_index = imp_gini_index))
}

```

We copy the data from the "dta" in case in the future we change the data which influences other models.

```{r}
# copy the dataframe in case we need to use the original dataframe
dta2 <- dta

# create a new dataframe with the selected variables
dta2 <- dta2[,c(IV1, IV2, IV3, DV)]
head(dta2)

```

```{r}
# compute the importance of the variables
# in this case, we only use the dummy variables to see the importance according to the DV, 
# which means only compute the IV2
imp_info_gain <- sapply(IV2, function(x) compute_importance(dta2, x, DV)$info_gain)
imp_gain_ratio <- sapply(IV2, function(x) compute_importance(dta2, x, DV)$gain_ratio)
imp_gini_index <- sapply(IV2, function(x) compute_importance(dta2, x, DV)$gini_index)
```

```{r}
# plot the importance of the variables, using the 3 different algorithms
par(mfrow = c(3,1))
barplot(imp_info_gain, main = "Importance of the Variables (Information Gain)", col = "lightblue")
barplot(imp_gain_ratio, main = "Importance of the Variables (Gain Ratio)", col = "lightgreen")
barplot(imp_gini_index, main = "Importance of the Variables (Gini Index)", col = "lightcoral")
```

All the 3 algorithms show that gender does not have much importance in predicting the satisfaction, so we can remove it from the analysis. There for we will have no more than $2^4=16$ leaf nodes, which is not too much.

```{r}
# remove the gender variable
IV_temp <- c("Customer_type_dummy","Type_of_travel_dummy","Class_business_dummy","Class_economy_dummy")

# create a new dataframe with the selected variables
dta2 <- dta2[,c(IV1, IV_temp, IV3, DV)]

# separate the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(46)
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(dta2), 0.8 * nrow(dta2))
train_data <- dta2[train_index,]
test_data <- dta2[-train_index,]
```

And we can see that the most important variable is the Class_business_dummy, so we pick it as the first variable to build the decision tree. Now we can compute the importance of the other variables using the 3 algorithms

Here is the new Selection Algorithm of Variables:

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1. Compute the importance of the variables using the 3 algorithms.In case 3 algs give different results, we scale each alg's result to 0-1 and take the average of the 3 results. 
  \item 2. Pick the biggest result as the selection critera for this node.
  \item 3. For new sepration, we get the new 2 datasets forthe child nodes, and repeat step 1 and 2 until we have 4 variables to build the decision tree.
\end{itemize}
```

```{r}
# Selection Algorithm of Variables function
select_var <- function(data, IV, DV) {

  # compute the importance of the variables
  imp_info_gain <- sapply(IV, function(x) compute_importance(data, x, DV)$info_gain)
  imp_gain_ratio <- sapply(IV, function(x) compute_importance(data, x, DV)$gain_ratio)
  imp_gini_index <- sapply(IV, function(x) compute_importance(data, x, DV)$gini_index)
  
  # scale the importance to 0-1
  imp_info_gain <- (imp_info_gain - min(imp_info_gain)) / (max(imp_info_gain) - min(imp_info_gain))
  imp_gain_ratio <- (imp_gain_ratio - min(imp_gain_ratio)) / (max(imp_gain_ratio) - min(imp_gain_ratio))
  imp_gini_index <- (imp_gini_index - min(imp_gini_index)) / (max(imp_gini_index) - min(imp_gini_index))
  
  # take the average of the 3 results
  imp_avg <- (imp_info_gain + imp_gain_ratio + imp_gini_index) / 3
  
  # pick the biggest result as the selection critera for this node
  selected_var <- IV[which.max(imp_avg)]
  
  return(selected_var)
}

# Implement the function
Build_tree <- function(data, IV, DV, depth) {
  variables <- IV

  if (depth == 0) return()
  
  # select the variable if there are more than 1 variable left
  if (length(variables) > 1)
    selected_var <- select_var(data, variables, DV)
  else
    selected_var <- variables[1]
  
  # split the data
  left_data <- data[data[[selected_var]] == 0,]
  right_data <- data[data[[selected_var]] == 1,]
  
  # print the selected variable
  print(paste("Selected Variable:", selected_var))

  # drop the selected variable from the list of variables
  variables <- variables[!variables %in% selected_var]
  
  # # print the importance of the selected variable
  # print(paste("Importance of the Selected Variable:", compute_importance(data, selected_var, DV)))
  
  # print the number of observations in the left and right nodes
  print(paste("This is level:", 4-depth+1))
  print("variables left:")
  print(variables)
  print(paste("Number of Observations in the Left Node:", nrow(left_data)))
  print(paste("Number of Observations in the Right Node:", nrow(right_data)))

  
  # repeat the process for the left and right nodes
  Build_tree(left_data, variables, DV, depth - 1)
  Build_tree(right_data, variables, DV, depth - 1)
}

# Function to compute the mean of the observations in each leaf node
compute_mean <- function(data) {
  mean_value <- mean(data[[DV]], na.rm = TRUE)
  return(mean_value)
}
```

```{r}
# Implement the function
Build_tree(train_data, IV_temp, DV, 4)
```

This can be considered as a DFS output of the decision tree.(not exactly DFS, but similar to it because we print the path of the tree in a depth-first manner.) It works but seeing that some leaf nodes have only few observations, so we concider pruning the tree in the future.

We can compute the mean of the observations in each leaf node as the new numerical value and later use it combining with other variables to build a logistic regression model.

There might be 2 ways to do this: 1. Not prune the tree and use the leaf nodes' average of the observations as the new numerical value to build one logistic regression model. 2. Prune the tree and store the leaf nodes to build several logistic regression models.

After we built in total 6 models based on the description above, we keep the best way as shown in the following. By comaprison, we choose the 2nd way to build the logistic regression model.

Now let's build the decision tree and prune it.

```{r}
# Recursive function to build the decision tree and prune it. Store the leaf nodes in a list and return it.
Build_tree_prune <- function(data, IV, DV, depth, min_obs) {
  leaves <- list()
  
  recursive_build <- function(data, IV, DV, depth, min_obs, path = list()) {

    if (nrow(data) < min_obs || depth == 0 || length(IV) == 0) {
      return(list(data = data, path = path)) 
    }
    

    if (length(IV) > 1) {
      selected_var <- select_var(data, IV, DV)
    } else {
      selected_var <- IV[1]
    }
    

    left_data <- data[data[[selected_var]] == 0, ]
    right_data <- data[data[[selected_var]] == 1, ]
    

    if (nrow(left_data) < min_obs || nrow(right_data) < min_obs) {
      return(list(data = data, path = path))
    }

    new_path_left <- c(path, paste(selected_var, "= 0"))
    new_path_right <- c(path, paste(selected_var, "= 1"))
    
    left_leaves <- if (nrow(left_data) > 0) recursive_build(left_data, IV[!IV %in% selected_var], DV, depth - 1, min_obs, new_path_left) else NULL
    right_leaves <- if (nrow(right_data) > 0) recursive_build(right_data, IV[!IV %in% selected_var], DV, depth - 1, min_obs, new_path_right) else NULL

    return(c(left_leaves, right_leaves))
  }
  
  leaves <- recursive_build(data, IV, DV, depth, min_obs)
  
  return(leaves)
}

```

Consider the dataset's size is in total 129880, and the train_data is 103904, so we can set the minimum number of observations in a leaf node to be 1% of the train_data, which is 1039.04, using 1000 as the minimum number of observations in a leaf node. After pruning, store the leaf nodes in a list, and we can consider the mean of the observations in each leaf node as the new numerical value and later use it combining with other variables to build a logistic regression model.

```{r}
# Implement the function
leaves_data <- Build_tree_prune(train_data, IV_temp, DV, 4, 1000)
# print the leaf nodes, dropping the NULL values
leaves_data <- leaves_data[!sapply(leaves_data, is.null)]
leaves_data
# get train_data_list from leaves_data, which is a list of dataframes and is the odd elements of leaves_data
train_data_list <- leaves_data[sapply(seq(leaves_data), function(x) x %% 2 == 1)]

# compute the mean of the observations in each leaf node and store each mean in the data's new column named "leaf_mean"
for (i in seq(length(train_data_list))) {
  train_data_list[[i]]$leaf_mean <- compute_mean(train_data_list[[i]])
}
```
Now we add the new variable "leaf_mean" to the testing data by using the mean of the observations in each leaf node.

```{r}
# Function to add the new variable "leaf_mean" to the testing data's dataframe column by using the mean_value from the training data's leaf node
# which means for the same path, we use the same mean_value for the testing data in the column "leaf_mean"
add_leaf_mean <- function(test_data, train_data_list) {
  test_data$leaf_mean <- NA
  
  for (i in seq(length(train_data_list))) {
    conditions <- leaves_data[2*i]$path
    mean_value <- train_data_list[[i]]$leaf_mean
    
    for (condition in conditions) {
      parts <- strsplit(condition, " = ")[[1]]
      variable <- parts[1]
      value <- as.numeric(parts[2])
      
      test_data$leaf_mean[test_data[[variable]] == value] <- mean_value
    }
  }
  
  return(test_data)
}

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# implement the function
train_data_new <- add_leaf_mean(train_data, train_data_list)
test_data_new <- add_leaf_mean(test_data, train_data_list)
```

Drop the IV_temp from the training and testing data, and we can build the logistic regression model using the new variables.

```{r}
# drop the IV_temp from the training and testing data
train_data_new <- train_data_new[, !names(train_data_new) %in% IV_temp]
test_data_new <- test_data_new[, !names(test_data_new) %in% IV_temp]
```

```{r}
# Function to adjust the path for the testing data

split_test_data <- function(test_data, leaves_data) {
  split_datasets <- list()

  len <- length(leaves_data)
  
  for (i in seq(len/2)) {

    current_subset <- test_data
    

    conditions <- leaves_data[2*i]$path
    # print(conditions)
    
    for (condition in conditions) {

      parts <- strsplit(condition, " = ")[[1]]
      variable <- parts[1]
      value <- as.numeric(parts[2])
      

      current_subset <- current_subset[current_subset[[variable]] == value, ]
    }
    

    split_datasets[[i]] <- current_subset
  }
  
  return(split_datasets)
}

```

```{r}
# implement the function
train_data_list_new <- split_test_data(train_data, leaves_data)
test_data_list_new <- split_test_data(test_data, leaves_data)
```

Logsitic Regression Model $$ \log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}+\beta_{2} x_{2}+\ldots+\beta_{n} x_{n} $$ where $p$ is the probability of the event that the dependent variable is 1, and $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ are the independent variables.

Explaining the logistic regression model: - The left-hand side of the equation is the log-odds of the dependent variable being 1. - The right-hand side of the equation is the linear combination of the independent variables. - The coefficients $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \ldots, \beta_{n}$ are the parameters of the model that need to be estimated. - The logistic function is used to transform the log-odds to the probability of the dependent variable being 1.

For the logistic regression model, we use the binomial family and the logit link function. In addion,In order to solve the issue arising in (f), we add a ridge penalty to the log-likelihood criterion: J(\boldsymbol{\beta})=-\ell(\boldsymbol{\beta})+\lambda\left[\alpha \sum_{j=1}^{p}\left|\beta_{j}\right|+\frac{1-\alpha}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{j}^{2}\right]where $\ell(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the log-likelihood criterion, $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter, and $p$ is the number of parameters in the model. where $\ell$($\beta$) denotes the log-likelihood function of the logistic regression model. Adapt the Newton-Raphson algorithm such that we obtain the regularised estimator of $\beta$ that minimizes J($\beta$). And $\alpha$ is the elastic net mixing parameter betwee 0 and1, which controls the trade-off between the L1 and L2 penalties. - When $\alpha=0$, the penalty is an L2 penalty, which is the ridge penalty. - When $\alpha=1$, the penalty is an L1 penalty, which is the lasso penalty. - When $0<\alpha<1$, the penalty is an elastic net penalty, which is a combination of the L1 and L2 penalties.

Newton-Raphson algorithm: 1. Initialize $\beta^{(0)}$. 2. For $k=0,1,2, \ldots$ until convergence: - Compute the gradient vector $\nabla J\left(\beta^{(k)}\right)$. - Compute the Hessian matrix $H\left(\beta^{(k)}\right)$. - Update $\beta^{(k+1)}=\beta^{(k)}-H^{-1}\left(\beta^{(k)}\right) \nabla J\left(\beta^{(k)}\right)$. - Check for convergence. - If converged, stop; otherwise, go to step 2. - The convergence criterion can be based on the change in the log-likelihood function or the change in the parameter estimates. -

Bulid different logistic regression models for each leaf node.

First of all, compute the accuracy of the original train_data and test_data into the logistic regression model as the baseline so that we can compare the accuracy of the new model with the baseline that we have.

accuracy1 <- train_and_evaluate_models(train_data_list_new, test_data_list_new, "Satisfaction_dummy")
```

From the results, we can see that the overall accuracy is 0.880086, which is higher than the baseline's accuracy. But Also, Accuracy for dataset are : 0.9244302, 0.8659287, 0.8474576, 0.8999653, 0.9003623, 0.9138666, 0.8085916. Especially the 7th dataset has a low accuracy.

We can use IV3 to build the logistic regression model for each leaf node and use the regression coefficients to predict the Satisfaction_dummy for the training dataset. Then, we can use the predicted Satisfaction_dummy named "IV3_predict" as a new variable to build the logistic regression model for the testing dataset.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# logistic regression model for the training dataset IV3
train_data_list_new3 <- list()
test_data_list_new3 <- list()
# for the training dataset
for (i in seq(length(train_data_list_new))) {
  model <- glm(Satisfaction_dummy ~ ., data = train_data_list_new[[i]], family = "binomial")
  train_data_list_new3[[i]] <- train_data_list_new[[i]]
  train_data_list_new3[[i]]$IV3_predict <- predict(model, newdata = train_data_list_new[[i]], type = "response")
  
  # for the testing dataset
  test_data_list_new3[[i]] <- test_data_list_new[[i]]
  test_data_list_new3[[i]]$IV3_predict <- predict(model, newdata = test_data_list_new[[i]], type = "response")
}
# drop the IV3 from the training and testing data
train_data_list_new3 <- lapply(train_data_list_new3, function(x) x[, !names(x) %in% IV3])
test_data_list_new3 <- lapply(test_data_list_new3, function(x) x[, !names(x) %in% IV3])
```

```{r}
# implement the function
accuracy2 <- train_and_evaluate_models(train_data_list_new3, test_data_list_new3, "Satisfaction_dummy")
```

Overall accuracy: 0.8852135 Accuracy for datasets are: 0.9378915, 0.8622386, 0.8487614, 0.9086488, 0.923913, 0.9129745, 0.8020663. Better than any other model we have.

This subsection the model is the one using IV3_predict as a new variable!

```
#### 3.2 Model, improvement, Random Forest

So far we have a not bad model but we still think the result is not good enough even though we mix different models' algorithms together. Now in this subsection, also take concern about avoiding overfitting, consider improving the tree-based model by implementing Random Forest algorithm.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Install the packages used in this tutorial:
packages <- c("C50", "ggplot2", "gmodels", "Hmisc", "randomForest", "rsample")

for (i in packages) {
    if(!require(i, character.only = TRUE)) {
        install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
    }
}
# Load necessary libraries
packages <- c("caret", "e1071", "pROC")
for (pkg in packages) {
    if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
        install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
        library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
    }
}

# Ensure the target variable is treated as a categorical variable (for classification)
train_data$Satisfaction_dummy <- as.factor(train_data$Satisfaction_dummy)
test_data$Satisfaction_dummy <- as.factor(test_data$Satisfaction_dummy)

# Build the random forest model
pmodel.forest <- randomForest(Satisfaction_dummy ~ ., 
                              data = train_data,
                              ntree = 50,   # Number of trees to grow
                              mtry = 2,     # Number of variables sampled at each split
                              replace = TRUE) # Sampling with replacement

# Predict the response on the test dataset
pred.test <- predict(pmodel.forest, newdata = test_data)

# Generate the confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- table(Actual = test_data$Satisfaction_dummy, Predicted = pred.test)
print("Confusion matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)

# Use CrossTable to generate a detailed confusion matrix if needed
conf_matrix <- CrossTable(x = test_data$Satisfaction_dummy, y = pred.test,
           prop.chisq = FALSE,
           prop.c = FALSE,
           prop.r = FALSE,
           prop.t = FALSE,
           dnn = c("Actual satisfaction", "Predicted satisfaction"))
conf_matrix
```

Based on the Confusion matrix we can calculate the accuracy of the model predictions:

```{r}
accuracy3 <- sum(diag(conf_matrix$t)) / sum(conf_matrix$t)
print(paste("Accuracy:", accuracy3))
```

As we can see from the result, this model has better performance!

Now we calculate the Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC of this model:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score
precision <- posPredValue(pred.test, test_data$Satisfaction_dummy, positive = "1")
recall <- sensitivity(pred.test, test_data$Satisfaction_dummy, positive = "1")
f1_score <- (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

print(paste("Precision:", round(precision, 4)))
print(paste("Recall:", round(recall, 4)))
print(paste("F1-Score:", round(f1_score, 4)))

# Calculate AUC
roc_obj <- roc(test_data$Satisfaction_dummy, as.numeric(pred.test))
auc_value <- auc(roc_obj)
print(paste("AUC:", round(auc_value, 4)))

```

### 4. Model 2, Wide & Deep

Next up we will use a more sophisticated algorithm, which is a combination of a generalized linear model and a feed-forward neural network: the Wide & Deep algorithm. This has the benefit of capturing better frequent co-occurrences in data through its wide linear model, while at the same time learning complex patterns through neural networks. In comparison to tree-based algorithms as discussed before, this algorithm should be more resilient to over-fitting. We expect to get a higher accuracy, but the result will be less interpretable than with tree-based models.

```{r}
dta4 <- dta

# create a new dataframe with the selected variables
dta4 <- dta4[,c(IV1, IV2, IV3, DV)]

```

Installing the required package for the model:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
if(!require(tensorflow)) install.packages("tensorflow")
library(tensorflow)

```

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tensorflow)
library(keras)
library(dplyr)

# Partitioning the data:
set.seed(46) 
train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(dta4)), size = floor(0.8 * nrow(dta4)))
train_data <- dta4[train_indices, ]
test_data <- dta4[-train_indices, ]

# Labeling the data
train_labels <- train_data$Satisfaction_dummy
test_labels <- test_data$Satisfaction_dummy

train_data <- dplyr::select(train_data, -Satisfaction_dummy)
test_data <- dplyr::select(test_data, -Satisfaction_dummy)
```

Rather just implementing the basic wide & deep model, we make some improvement by involving the drop out rate to give the possibility to reset the cells and avoid over-fitting, and using the residual connection which first came up with the ResNet model in deep learning by Professor Jian Sun (Yuxiao's professor).

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# For wide models, we use numerical features directly
# For deep models, we use embedding layers to handle a mixture of categorical features and numerical features

# define input
numeric_inputs <- lapply(names(train_data), function(name) layer_input(shape = 1, name = paste0(name, "_input")))
all_inputs <- numeric_inputs
all_inputs_list <- unlist(numeric_inputs)

# Define wide model section
wide_features <- layer_concatenate(all_inputs_list) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = 'linear') 

# Define deep model part
deep_features <- layer_concatenate(all_inputs_list) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_batch_normalization() %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_batch_normalization() %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.5)


# Optionally adding Residual Connections
# First dense layer
residual_input <- deep_features
residual_output <- layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu')(residual_input) %>%
  layer_batch_normalization()

# Second dense layer (repeat structure if needed and then add the residual)
residual_output <- layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu')(residual_output) %>%
  layer_batch_normalization()


# Adding the residual connection
residual_output <- layer_add(list(residual_input, residual_output)) %>%
  layer_activation('relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.5)

# Use the output from the residual block as the final deep feature representation
deep_features <- residual_output

# Combine the output of wide and deep models
final_output <- layer_concatenate(list(wide_features, deep_features)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = 'sigmoid')

#Create model
model <- keras_model(inputs = all_inputs_list, outputs = final_output)

# Compile model
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'binary_crossentropy',
  optimizer = 'adam',
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
# Convert training data and test data to the format of model input
train_list <- lapply(names(train_data), function(name) as.matrix(train_data[[name]]))
test_list <- lapply(names(test_data), function(name) as.matrix(test_data[[name]]))

```

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Train the model.
history <- model %>% fit(
  x = train_list,
  y = train_labels,
  batch_size = 32,
  epochs = 10,
  validation_split = 0.2
)

# Evaluate the model on unseen data.
model %>% evaluate(test_list, test_labels)

```

```{r,warning=FALSE}
packages <- c("caret", "e1071", "pROC","gmodels")
for (pkg in packages) {
    if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
        install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
        library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
    }
}

# Predict probabilities for the test set
predictions_prob <- model %>% predict(test_list)
predictions <- ifelse(predictions_prob > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Convert predictions and test_labels to factors if they are not already
# This ensures that CrossTable handles the data correctly
predictions_factor <- factor(predictions, levels = c(0, 1))
test_labels_factor <- factor(test_labels, levels = c(0, 1))

# Use CrossTable to generate a detailed confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- CrossTable(x = test_labels_factor, y = predictions_factor,
                          prop.chisq = FALSE,  # Turn off chi-squared test p-value calculation
                          prop.c = FALSE,      # Do not show column percentages
                          prop.r = FALSE,      # Do not show row percentages
                          prop.t = FALSE,      # Do not show table percentages
                          dnn = c("Actual satisfaction", "Predicted satisfaction"),
                          format = "SPSS")  # This format is akin to what SPSS outputs, very detailed

# Print the detailed confusion matrix
print("Detailed Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
```

Here we caculate the Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC of this model again:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
predictions_factor <- factor(predictions, levels = c(0, 1))
test_labels_factor <- factor(test_labels, levels = c(0, 1))

# Calculate confusion matrix and extract metrics
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions_factor, test_labels_factor)
precision <- conf_matrix$byClass['Pos Pred Value']
recall <- conf_matrix$byClass['Sensitivity']
f1_score <- 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)

print(paste("Precision:", round(precision, 4)))
print(paste("Recall:", round(recall, 4)))
print(paste("F1-Score:", round(f1_score, 4)))
```

### 5. Results, discussion and recommendations

#### 5.1 Results and discussion

A comparative analysis is conducted between the random forest model and the proposed Wide & Deep model, evaluating them based on accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 values. The dataset is partitioned into training, and test set, with the baseline model trained and assessed through cross-validation. In contrast, the Wide & Deep model undergoes training on the training set, tuning on the validation set, and final evaluation on the test set. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the Wide & Deep model outperforms others, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, f1 value, and AUC scores. Following closely is the random forest model, exhibiting commendable performance across various metrics. Conversely, the decision tree model demonstrates the weakest performance. Overall, the Wide & Deep model emerges as an effective prediction tool for analyzing airline passenger satisfaction.

1.  **Accuracy** (ACC) proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances evaluated:

    $$
    ACC = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
    $$

2.  **Precision** (PREC) proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances that were predicted as positive. It is calculated as:

    $$
    PREC = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
    $$

3.  **Recall (Sensitivity)** (REC), also known as sensitivity, quantifies the ability of a model to correctly identify positive instances out of all actual positive instances. It is calculated as:

    $$
    REC = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
    $$

4.  **F1 Score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall, calculated as:

    $$
    F1 = 2 \times \frac{PREC \times REC}{PREC + REC}
    $$

5.  **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)**: AUC measures the performance of a classification model at various threshold settings. It is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold values. A higher AUC indicates better performance of the model in distinguishing between positive and negative instances.

Table. Performance comparison results.

prf.comp <- data.frame(accuracy = character(2),
                       precision = character(2),

                       f1score = character(2),
                       auc = character(2))

Flight delays not only incur costs for airlines but also significantly impact passengers' travel experiences, especially for those who opt to proceed with delayed flights. Their satisfaction is intricately tied to the in-flight service during delays. This study addresses a gap in existing research by employing machine learning and deep learning techniques for passenger satisfaction prediction, with a focus on model interpretability. Utilizing the Wide & Deep model, which facilitates feature interaction, coupled with interpretability analysis via the DeepLIFT algorithm, we present a novel approach to passenger satisfaction prediction. The main conclusions derived from this study are as follows:

In the binary classification prediction task concerning on-board service satisfaction post-delay, the Wide & Deep model is chosen due to its capability to internalize both explicit and implicit feature interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Through rigorous model refinement processes including hyperparameter tuning and overfitting mitigation, significant performance improvements are achieved. Empirical analysis conducted on publicly available airline passenger satisfaction datasets validates the efficacy of the Wide & Deep model in enhancing passenger satisfaction prediction accuracy and overall performance. Ablation experiments further underscore the importance of various model components such as the Wide side, Deep side, Embedding layer, and MLP layers in contributing to predictive efficacy.

#### 5.2 Action Plan Proposal

To enhance airline customer satisfaction based on the findings of our research, a structured action plan is proposed:

Firstly, the integration of the developed Wide & Deep predictive model into the airline's customer satisfaction management system will be prioritized. This entails the seamless incorporation of real-time data feeds from flight operations and customer feedback to continuously refine and update the predictive model. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for this initiative include the frequency of model updates and the alignment of predicted outcomes with actual customer satisfaction ratings.

Secondly, a focus on personalized service enhancement will be paramount. Insights gleaned from the predictive model will guide the customization of in-flight services and experiences to align with individual passenger preferences and behaviors. Actionable KPIs will include the percentage increase in passenger satisfaction ratings for personalized service offerings and the correlation between predictive model recommendations and actual passenger choices.

Operational optimization strategies will also be pursued to minimize service disruptions and maximize efficiency. Predictive analytics will be leveraged to anticipate and mitigate potential issues such as flight delays or cancellations, while staffing levels and resource allocation will be optimized based on predicted passenger demand. KPIs for this initiative will include reductions in flight delays and cancellations and improvements in resource utilization efficiency.

Enhanced communication and transparency efforts will be undertaken to foster trust and confidence among passengers. This will involve the implementation of improved communication channels during flight delays or disruptions, providing timely updates and transparent information. KPIs for this action item will include the percentage increase in passenger satisfaction with communication during disruptions and the reduction in customer complaints related to information transparency.

A continuous improvement and feedback loop will be established to ensure ongoing refinement of customer satisfaction initiatives. A feedback mechanism will capture post-flight satisfaction ratings and reviews, which will be analyzed alongside predictive model outcomes to identify areas for improvement. KPIs will include improvements in overall passenger satisfaction scores and the number of actionable insights derived from feedback analysis.

Employee training and empowerment programs will be implemented to enhance customer service capabilities and responsiveness. Frontline staff will be equipped with the necessary tools and authority to address passenger concerns promptly, with KPIs including improvements in staff satisfaction and reductions in customer service response times.

Collaboration with industry partners and service providers will be pursued to enhance the overall travel experience. Partnerships will be leveraged to offer exclusive perks and benefits to frequent flyers, further enhancing loyalty and satisfaction levels. KPIs for this initiative will include increases in customer loyalty metrics and the number of positive customer testimonials attributable to partnership initiatives.

Marketing and branding efforts will highlight the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction through targeted campaigns and initiatives. Personalized service offerings, operational reliability, and proactive customer care will be emphasized as key differentiators in the competitive airline market. KPIs will include improvements in brand perception metrics and increases in customer retention rates.

Strict adherence to data governance practices and regulatory compliance will be maintained to safeguard passenger privacy and trust. Robust security measures will be implemented to protect sensitive passenger data, with KPIs including compliance audit results and incident response effectiveness.

Lastly, performance monitoring and evaluation will be conducted regularly to track the effectiveness of customer satisfaction initiatives and predictive model performance. KPIs will include improvements in overall customer satisfaction scores, reductions in customer complaints, and increases in operational efficiency metrics.
